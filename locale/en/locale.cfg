[mod-setting-description]
heavy-freight-fuel-consumption-modifier=Multiplier to fuel consumption.  100x is balanced for Angels (due to coke pellets total MJ per stack), 50x if you use my fuel stack balance mod. 10x is easier but still with noticible cost and 400x will require refuling or higher quality fuel for all but short runs.  1x uses default settings.
heavy-freight-restrict-fuel-inventory-size=Restricts fuel inventory size to 1 to make higher quality fuel more valuable.  NOTE: You will need to manage fuel carefully if you use more than one type.
brake-nerf-factor=Reduces effeciveness of brakes so trains take longer to stop.  At 4 stopping distance is slightly longer than time to accelerate to full speed.  Set to 8 if you want brakes/acceleration to be similar after upgrading tech.  Set to 2 for less of an effect, or 1 to disable.
